## Usage

## Project Progress
#####Progress Summary
This project began by constantly comparing and cross-referencing multiple sources in order to understand the different 
methods to structure the project, the different methods of implementing data preprocessing, and the reasons for deciding
 to use each of these methods. 

At first, the labeled training and unlabeled test images were preprocessed into 64x64 px images and loaded into RAM for 
conversion into a train.npy and test.npy file. This was done in order to perform numpy array slicing to split the 
training data into separate train, validation, and test sets.
